# Redis Pub/Sub Example

This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the Redis Publish/Subscribe (Pub/Sub) pattern using Node.js and the `ioredis` library. It includes a basic Express server that can send and receive messages through Redis channels.

## Features

- Publish messages to a Redis channel.
- Subscribe to a Redis channel to receive messages.
- Error handling for Redis operations.
- Input validation for API requests.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Ensure you have Redis installed and running. You can download it from [Redis.io](https://redis.io/download).

## Usage

1. Set up your environment variables (see [Environment Variables](#environment-variables)).
2. Start the application:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. The server will run on `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Endpoints

### Send Message

- **POST** `/api/send`
- **Request Body**: 
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Your message here"
  }
  ```
- **Response**:
  - Status `200 OK`: 
    ```json
    {
      "status": "Ok!",
      "message": "Message successfully sent!"
    }
    ```
  - Status `400 Bad Request`:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "Error",
      "message": "Message is required."
    }
    ```
  - Status `500 Internal Server Error`:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "Error",
      "message": "Failed to send message."
    }
    ```

## Environment Variables

To configure the Redis connection, set the following environment variables:

- `REDIS_HOST`: The host of your Redis server (default: `localhost`).
- `REDIS_PORT`: The port of your Redis server (default: `6379`).
- `REDIS_PASSWORD`: The password for your Redis server (if applicable).

You can create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project to define these variables.

## Error Handling

The application includes error handling for Redis operations, ensuring that any issues during publishing or subscribing are logged and handled gracefully. Input validation is also implemented to ensure that messages are provided in the request.
